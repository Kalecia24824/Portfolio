<em>by Kalecia McNeal</em>

## About:  
Welcome to the Web Development sub-directory! Here you will find all of my projects that involve developing websites. Each folder will focus on different areas of a website. The folders will have a design, some code and a reflection page detailing my process. 


## Folder Directory:  

### Single Pages:
These are the projects that will be various single pages of a website. These include homepages, emails, single-ons that we see today. 

- Here is the folder link:

This folder is designed to contain website projects that have more than one page. In this section, navigation will be the main focus.
