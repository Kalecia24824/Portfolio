## Process: 

### Part 1: The Beginning:
For this project, I wanted to create my own menu based from the freeCodeCamp Cafe Menu. Firstly, I went to Pixabay to pick out a lemon background. Then I decided on some selections to three categories: food, drinks and desserts because a cafe might have all three. 

### Part 2: Middle: 
With the background image, theme in mind and selection list, it was time to bring the menu to life. I started by coding the menu using HTML basic elements such as h1, img, article. Then it was time to add the styling to the menu. As for the styling, I knew the menu needed some nice font. So, I went to Google Fonts to pick out "Concert One" since it was the closest to a menu font.

### Part 3: Finale:
Next, I formatted the background using the background image of lemons and light yellow coloring. Afterwards, I made the other images smaller and changed the listing to green and yellow to match the theme. Overall, I enjoyed the project since it was the easiest to do in 2 days.
