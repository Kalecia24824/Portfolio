## Process:

### Part 1 - The Beginning: 
Since I completed the nutrition label project on freeCodeCamp, I decided I wanted to add my own rendition. So, I coded the elements again in the index file using semantics such as span and div. 

### Part 2 - Middle:
Then, it was time to do the CSS styling for the project. I changed the white to red because I wanted the label to be reminiscent of a cereal label.   

### Part 3 - Finale: 
For the final part, I checked to make sure everything was good. I also increased the font size of some elements just to make sure the user can read the words better. 

### Acknowledgements: 
Thank you to freeCodeCamp for providing me with the inspiration for this project!
