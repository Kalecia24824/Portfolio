## 🔄 Process & Challenges
The process started easy enough with coding the index.file using HTML. For this project, I wanted to make a blog so I used the article, main, heading and paragraph elements along with the footer at the bottom. Next came the CSS, where I wanted to create a simple campfire feel for the page so I used the colors of red, orange and white.
