## Process:

### Part 1 - The Beginning: 
For this project, I wanted to create a price grid card for an art subscription. So, I thought an artsy background from Pixabay and light colors would do. Then, setting up the HTML was easy. I spilt the ad into 3 different sections called the header, why ans subscription. 

### Part 2 - Middle: 
After adding everything in the HTML file, I got started on the CSS. Now, I will admit the grid card was not easy at all. It took a few tries to get together. Next, I did the background of the grids, added the necessary fonts and use coloring for the price along with the button.

### Part 3 - Finale: 
At the end, I added some responsive design for a smaller screen size. Before finishing up, I made sure to adjust the padding and margin sizes for the headers, list and paragraph elements. Overall I will say I had a great time making this.
