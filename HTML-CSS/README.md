# HTML/CSS Folder 
<em>by Kalecia McNeal</em>

## Intro: 
Welcome to the HTML and CSS Folder! HTML or HyperText Markup Language is responsible for displaying information as text on a web page. While CSS or Cascading Style Sheets allows the programmer to decorate the page using visuals. Here ypu find all of my projects that are based on the two languages. 

## Skills: 
With that in mind, here are some skills the developer will gain after learning about HTML and CSS.
