## Process 

### Beginning: 
To start, I wanted to create a simple link button that showed an effect when the user clicked on it. So, I knew the HTML would be easy since the code would be the a element which allows you to link. 

### Middle: 
After the HTML was done, the bulk of the project was the CSS. For starters, I decided to do the color purple just to showcase the effect. In the stylesheet, the a element has the most styling including the font, background color and the hover effect. 

### End:
At the end, I was confused at first because the effect did not show up. But then I went back into the code and I made a small error that fixed it. So, I happy with the effect
