## Process 

### Beginning: 
Since this was based on the Lightning Button, I thought I could change it to make the button resemble a heart beating. In order to do that, I needed to find a heart icon and the colors to match it. 

### Middle: 
After going on Flaticon, I was able to find a good icon that would work. Then it was time to make the project with the HTML elements such as div, i and the img. Afterwords, the only thing left is the CSS styling. I started with a light red background since the theme of the project is red. Then I used CSS grid styling for the container, icon, and circle classes.
 

### End:
In the latter classes, I used the animation properties in order to mimic a heart's beat. The last thing I need to do was the keyframes in order to activate the animation properties. For the pulse keyframe, I used the transform property. As for the widen keyframe, I used the border-width property.

### Credits: 
The main credit goes to Zero to Mastery where my project was based on the lightening button animation. I would also like to give a credit to Flaticon for providing free access to download icons
