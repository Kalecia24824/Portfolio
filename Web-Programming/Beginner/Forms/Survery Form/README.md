# Survey Form 

## About 
Welcome to the Survey Form README! Here, you can find all information about the project from the objective to acknowledgements. 

## Objective 

### Goal of The Project:
The goal of the project is to create a form as a survey for users to fill out.  

### Reason Why: 
The main reason is because users use surveys online or in-person to collect information for data.

### Skills Needed: 
- Basic HTML (semantic and form elements)
- Basic CSS (formatting)

## Process: 

### Beginning: 
In order to make this form, I had learn about basic HTML and CSS elements from learning resources such as W3Schools and freeCodeCamp which will be credited at the end. Once I learned about these elements such as (form), (input) and (label). Then it was time to start building the project.

### Middle: 
I started building this project on freeCodeCamp since they always have a built-in IDE environment. The HTML coding was easy using elements with form in the beginning, input and label elements in the middle finishing the textarea and submit buttons at the end. 

### Conclusion: 
After the HTML form was done, I started on the CSS styling for the web form. I chose the color purple for the background, light yellow for the input areas and white for the text for contrast. Once the CSS is done, I knew the project has concluded.
