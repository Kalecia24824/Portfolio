# My Portfolio 
<em>by Kalecia McNeal</em>

## Introduction: 
Hello, my name is Kalecia McNeal! I am a Web Developer who is looking to grow. I graduated from Florida State University with a Bachelor's in Information Technology. My goal for my portfolio is to show my progress within each language I learn and build my own projects I can be proud of! 

## Folder List: 
Each folder is a language I use when coding. These folders will hold their own mini-projects to showcase the skills I learned. 

### HTML/CSS:
The HTML/CSS folder is designed to hold all projects based on what the user is able to see and read. For more info you can access the README here:
[HTML/CSS README](/HTML-CSS/README.md "My HTML-CSS README")

### JS: 
The JS folder holds all of my JavaScript projects which let the webpage become interactive through various event listers. For more info you can access the README here: 
[JS README](/JS/README.md "My JS README")

### My Projects: 
The Projects folder will contain all of my independent projects. These projects are responsible for showing my mastery in HTML/CSS and JS. For more info you can access the README here: 
[Projects README](/Projects/README.md "My Projects README")
