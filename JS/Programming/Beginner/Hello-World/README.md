# 👩‍💻 Project Hello World
Welcome to the Hello World README in the Beginner folder!

## 📖 Summary
Create the traditional first program by displaying "Hello, World!" using the console.

## 🧠 Skills Acquired
- Basic JS (console)
- Strings

## 🛠️ Tools & Tech
- JS6
- Node.js 
- Visual Studio Code 

## 🔄 Process & Challenges
The code was really simple. All I had to do was type "Hello, World!" in the console using console.log. I will say it did not work at first because I did not have the necessary tech Node.js installed first. But after that, the program worked like it needed to. 

Here is the final screenshot of the program:
