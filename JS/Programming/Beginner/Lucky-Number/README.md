# 👩‍💻 Project Lucky Number
Welcome to the Lucky Number README in the Beginner folder!

## 📖 Summary
Create a program that generates a random "lucky number" for a user based on their birth year and favorite number.

## 🧠 Skills Acquired  
- Math methods
- Strings and Data Types 
- Function declaration
- Basic input using readline (Node.js)

## 🛠️ Tools & Tech
- JS6
- Node.js 
- Visual Studio Code 

## 🔄 Process & Challenges
The process of this project starts with figuring out how to create the function necessary to generate the user's lucky number. So, I figured there were 3 methods in the Math class that would work (random, floor and absolute). After finding out those methods, then it was time to create the function using 2 variables: the user's birth year and their favorite number. I made 3 addition variables using the Math methods to calculate the final lucky number. As for the input and output, I used readline since I am using Node.js.
