# üçµ JavaScript Folder
This folder showcases my progress in learning JavaScript, from basic programming concepts to more complex, interactive projects. 

## ‚ú® Goal
There are 2 sub-folders called Applications and Programming. The application folder allows the user to experiment various web-based projects using JS. The programming folder contains different coding exercises based on the difficulty. Every project is categorized from 

## üß∞ Tools & Technologies
- JavaScript (ES6+)
- DOM API
- Event Handling
- Fetch API
- Async/Await
- Local Storage

## üìÇ Sub-Folders
