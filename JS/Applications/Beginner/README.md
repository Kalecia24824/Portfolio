# üå± The Beginner Project Folder
Welcome to the **Beginner** sub folder in the Applications folder! In this folder, there are some beginner friendly projects designed to showcase my demonstration in JS fundamentals, function, events and basic DOM manipulation.

## ‚úÖ Skills Practiced
These are the skills you will see in each project: 
- Creating variables (let, const)
- Utilizing data types (strings, numbers, booleans and more)
- Basic DOM manipulation (getElementById, querySelector)
- Structuring HTML, styling with CSS and interactivity with JS
