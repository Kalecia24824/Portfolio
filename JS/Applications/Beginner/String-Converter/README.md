## 🔄 Process & Challenges
For this project I wanted to create a string converter where the user could simply enter a word or sentence then it would be formatted along with a character count. For the HTML, I just made an input using the input and submit buttons so the user can enter then click. 

For the CSS, I wanted to do a monochromatic indigo scheme. As for the JS for the script to work for the project, I need to code 2 things: a function and an event lister. The function was easy to do since I just needed to use some methods including slice, trim and map along with an if..else loop. 

The hard part was the DOM model since I tend to get nervous when coding with DOM elements. For that, I needed 3 variables that targeted the HTML elements to connect to the script I was using. Lastly, I made a click event lister that would display the result once the user hits submit. 

Here is the final result:
