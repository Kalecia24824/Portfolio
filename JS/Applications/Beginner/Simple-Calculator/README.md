# üìå Project Simple Calculator (App Version)
Welcome to the Simple Calculator README in the Beginner folder of JS! This is the app version of the program with the same name  

## üìñ Summary
Create a simple program where the user can do basic math functions by making a calculator. 

## üß† Skills:
- HTML Semantic Structure (div and button)
- HTML Form elements (input and button interaction)
- CSS Layout (FlexBox and Grid)
- CSS Responsive Design (media queries for mobile and desktop)
- JS DOM manipulation (.querySelector and handling user input)
- JS Basic logic and control flow (functions, operations, and cases)

## üõ†Ô∏è Tools & Tech
- HTML5
- CSS3
- JS6
- Visual Studio Code 
- Google Chrome 

## üîÑ Process & Challenges
For this program, I wanted to create a simple calculator users can solve their simple math problems by inputting 2 numbers and select the operation. For the HTML, I knew I needed a form-like structure to get the user's input. So, I used label, input for the text and select element for the dropdown menu. 

For CSS, I used a blue theme color scheme with a striking blue background, light blue body for the calculator and white for the input. As for the JS, I needed to create a function to attach the interactivity to the index.html. 

To do that, I used basic DOM model to create JS variable assignments by attaching them to the num and operation elements from HTML file. Afterwards, I used the switch loop method to make sure each operation can be performed. Then I displayed the result at the end

Here is the final result:
